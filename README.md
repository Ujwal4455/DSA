## **📂 Data Structures Covered**  

### **📜 List**  
A **list** is a sequence of elements where duplicates are allowed, and order is maintained.  

🔹 **Operations:**  
- **Traversal** – Access elements sequentially.  
- **Insertion** – Add elements at specific positions.  
- **Deletion** – Remove elements by value or position.  
- **Searching** – Locate elements in the list.  
- **Sorting** – Arrange elements in a particular order.  

🔹 **Example Programs:**  
✅ Reverse a list.  
✅ Sort a list using bubble sort.  
✅ Find the largest element in a list.  

---

### **🏗️ Structures**  
A **structure** is a user-defined data type that groups related variables together.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- Represent **complex entities** (e.g., student records, employee details).  
- Manage multiple fields efficiently in **competitive programming**.  

🔹 **Examples:**  
✅ Define a **student structure** with fields like `name`, `age`, and `grade`.  
✅ Implement operations to **input and display** structured data.  

---

### **🔗 Linked List**  
A **linked list** is a collection of nodes where each node stores data and a reference to the next node.  

🔹 **Types:**  
1️⃣ **Singly Linked List** – Each node points to the next node only.  
2️⃣ **Circular Linked List** – The last node links back to the first node.  

🔹 **Operations:**  
✅ Create a linked list.  
✅ Insert and delete nodes at different positions.  
✅ Traverse the list efficiently.  

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
- **Dynamic memory allocation**  
- **Hierarchical data representation (e.g., menus)**  

---

### **🌳 Tree**  
A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.  

🔹 **Binary Tree:** Each node has at most two children.  
🔹 **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A sorted tree for efficient searching and insertion.  

🔹 **Common Traversals:**  
- **In-order** (Left → Root → Right)  
- **Pre-order** (Root → Left → Right)  
- **Post-order** (Left → Right → Root)  

🔹 **Advanced Trees:**  
✅ **AVL Tree** – A self-balancing BST.  
✅ **Heap Tree** – Used in priority queues and sorting.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- **Expression evaluation**  
- **Game development (e.g., AI decision trees)**  

---

### **🗝️ Hash Functions**  
Hashing maps data to a fixed-size value (hash code) for **quick access**.  

🔹 **Implementation:**  
✅ Design hash functions for data indexing.  
✅ Handle **collisions** using:  
   - **Chaining** – Store multiple values in the same index using linked lists.  
   - **Open Addressing** – Find alternative storage locations.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- **Dictionary operations**  
- **Efficient caching mechanisms**  

---

### **↔️ Doubly Linked List**  
A **doubly linked list** allows traversal in **both forward and reverse** directions.  

🔹 **Operations:**  
✅ Insert and delete nodes efficiently.  
✅ Traverse in **both directions**.  

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
- **Undo functionality** in text editors.  
- **Web browser history navigation**.  

---

### **📦 Stack**  
A **stack** follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.  

🔹 **Operations:**  
✅ **Push** – Add elements to the top.  
✅ **Pop** – Remove elements from the top.  
✅ **Peek** – View the top element.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- **Expression evaluation** (e.g., converting infix to postfix).  
- **Backtracking algorithms** (e.g., maze solving).  
- **Function call management (call stack)**.  

---

### **🚶‍♂️ Queue**  
A **queue** follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.  

🔹 **Types:**  
✅ **Simple Queue** – Basic enqueue/dequeue operations.  
✅ **Circular Queue** – Efficient memory utilization.  
✅ **Priority Queue** – Elements with higher priority are dequeued first.  

🔹 **Operations:**  
✅ **Enqueue** – Add elements at the rear.  
✅ **Dequeue** – Remove elements from the front.  
✅ **Peek** – View the front element.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- **Task scheduling (e.g., CPU scheduling)**.  
- **Managing print jobs in a printer queue**.  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs**.  

---

### **🌐 Graphs**  
A **graph** consists of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**.  

🔹 **Representation:**  
✅ **Adjacency Matrix** – 2D array storing connections.  
✅ **Adjacency List** – Each vertex stores its neighbors.  

🔹 **Types of Graphs:**  
✅ **Directed vs. Undirected** graphs.  
✅ **Weighted vs. Unweighted** graphs.  

🔹 **Key Algorithms:**  
✅ **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores as deep as possible.  
✅ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Explores all neighbors before moving deeper.  
✅ **Shortest Path Algorithms:**  
   - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Finds the shortest path in weighted graphs.  
   - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** – Handles graphs with negative weights.  

🔹 **Applications:**  
- **Social networks (e.g., Facebook friend suggestions)**.  
- **Network routing (e.g., Internet packet forwarding)**.  
- **Solving puzzles like mazes**.
